# Weight Prediction Using Machine Learning
---
## 📜 Project Description:
  This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates an individual’s weight based on their height. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we analyze the relationships between height and 
  weight, evaluate various models for accuracy, and deploy the best-performing model for real-time use via a web application. The project emphasizes simplicity, interpretability, and ease of use, making it 
  accessible for non-technical users.

## ⚙ Algorithms Evaluated:
Three machine learning algorithms were applied and compared based on Mean Squared Error (MSE):
1 Linear Regression:
 - Simplest and most interpretable model.
 - Achieved the best `MSE = 21.6973.`
2 Random Forest Regression:
 - Ensemble method that reduces overfitting.
 - `MSE = 2708.3037.`
3 Decision Tree Regression:
 - Captures non-linear relationships but prone to overfitting.
 - `MSE = 41.5075.`
- **Conclusion:** Linear Regression outperformed other models due to the dataset's linear nature and was selected for deployment.
